        "The Muller family lived at 3 rue de l'Avenir in the 20th arrondissement. Manek and Rachel emigrated from Poland in the 1930s and set up shop as home-based dressmakers. During the war, their four children - Henri, Jean, Annette and Michel - attended school on rue Olivier-Metra.",
        "On July 16, 1942, French police officers came to arrest Rachel and the children. Manek, warned of an imminent round-up and convinced that it would only concern men, hid the day before with a neighbor. The two eldest sons, Henri and Jean, managed to escape and were reunited with their father. Annette, Michel and their mother were taken to the VÃ©lodrome d'Hiver where they stayed for several days before being taken to the Pithiviers camp. On August 7, 1942, Rachel was deported from Pithiviers on convoy #16 and arrived at Auschwitz on August 9. Only Manek and the children survived.",
        "In 1991, Annette published La Petite Fille du Vel d'Hiv, which she dedicated to her mother, Rachel. In his preface, Serge Klarsfeld says that \"Annette has become the family memorialist. Annette's account is movingly intense, so much so that her love for her mother dominated her life as a child; a cheerful, beautiful, intelligent, hard-working, flirtatious and sociable mother.\" On the day of the roundup, the mother begs: \"Don't take the children\".",
        "Annette died on August 9, 2021. 79 years to the day after her mother disappeared in Auschwitz."
